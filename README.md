## Fund Tracking and Donation making App for Wildlife Conservation facility
## Project Proposal:


A wildlife conservation facility provides rescue and rehabilitation services to injured wildlife. The facility accepts and shelters injured wildlife and release them to the wild once
they recovered from the injury. A large portion of the funds that supports the facility are raised from the public through donations from animal lovers
To encourage the donations from the public, many non-profit organizations created websites that contains the profiles of 
the wildlife they attempt to rescue and encourages the public to make donations to their favorite animals through symbolic adoptions. one of the examples
are can be accessed here (https://support.worldwildlife.org/site/Donation2?df_id=17797&17797.donation=form1&s_src=AWE2308OQ18297A06836RX&s_subsrc=homepage)


In my personal project, I want to design a fund tracking app for a newly established wildlife conservation facility. 
This app can be used to add and create a profile for every wildlife sheltered at the facility and updates its donation records, list of donors
and the total amount of donations (funds). This app will allow the donor to make donation to a certain wildlife sheltered at the site. The same donor
will be able to track his/her donation records by using his donor profile. This project is particularly interesting to me as it 
can help the conservation facility to systematically tracks and manage their funding collected from the public and help them create
new strategy to attract public donations.

The app is designed to be used by two types of users:
- Administration team at the conservation site:
- They will use the app to add new wildlife profile, track the donation records and funding progression of each wildlife at the facility) 

- people who make donations to the wildlife in the facility:
- They will use the app to make symbolic adoptions to their chosen wildlife, create donor profiles, and track their donation records




Staff at the conservation site will be able to add/do the following
- Add a new wildlife profile (the wildlife species name, important information such as conservation status, target funding, and a short description  


User stories:

Phase 1

- As an admin user I want to be able to add new wildlife to my wildlife conservation site
- As an admin user I want to be able to add important information for the added wildlife such as target funding, species name, conservation status, admission date, and a short description
- As an admin user I want to be able to view the list of wildlife in my conservation site
- As an admin user I want to be able to view the list of donors and their information (email address, donor ID, and profile creation date)

- As a donor user I want to be able to make donation to a wildlife in the conservation site
- As a donor user I want to be able to create a donor profile with a donor ID and an email address
- As a donor user I want to be able to view my donation records  

Phase 2
- As a user I want to know the total funding required for animals of each conservation status
- As a feature the system will automatically remove the animals whose raised funds has exceeded the target funding. The extra funds collected in the last donation will be transferred to an wildlife that has the least funding and have the most concerned conservation status
