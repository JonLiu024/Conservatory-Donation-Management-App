# CPSC 210 Personal Project by Tong Liu
## Fund Tracking App for Wildlife Preservation Facilities
## Project Proposal:

In this personal project, I want to design an application that can be used to track funding for a newly established wildlife preservation facility. This app will allow the conservationists to raise and track funds from the public to for the expenses of animal sheltering at the facility. The app will allow donors to make and record their amount of donations for sheltered wildlife


The app is designed to be used by two types of users:
- Staff at the conservation site.  
- wildlife preservation supporters who make donations through symbolic adoption of animals




Staff at the conservation site will be able to add/do the following
- Add new sheltered animals
- Animal nickname
- Animal species name
- Endangered level of the species
- A short description or story behind the sheltered animals
- Target funding
- Expected Shelter period
- Remove animals


Wildlife preservation supporters will be able to select an individual animal from the list and enter the amount of funding they wish to donate.

These will be added to a system which can be requested by the users to review the list of animals being sheltered at the preservation facility and review the total funding required for each individual animal at the conservation site. This application will guide users through what they should input to help them ensure that important information of each sheltered animal is correctly stored into the system. I hope to expand the scope of this project during term to include other features and increase the functionality of the app
