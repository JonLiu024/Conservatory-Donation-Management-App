# CPSC 210 Personal Project by Tong Liu
## Fund Tracking App for Wildlife Preservation Facilities
## Project Proposal:

In this project, I want to design an application that can be used to monitor and track funding for a newly established wildlife conservation facility. 
The wildlife conservation facility provides rescue and rehabilitation services to injured wildlife. The facility accept and shelters injured wildlife and release them to the wild once
they recovered from the injury. A large portion of the funds that supports the facility comes from public donations such as symbolic adoptions from animal lovers and the active donations from ecological activists
To encourage the donations from the public, many non-profit organizations have created  has 

This app provides create a profiles for every wildlife that the facility shelters 
and This app will allow the public to make donation to to raise and track funding from the public for the expenses of wildlife sheltering at the facility. The app will allow donors to make and record their amount of donations for their chosen wildlife *(wildlife)*

One of the examples  https://support.worldwildlife.org/site/Donation2?df_id=17797&17797.donation=form1&s_src=AWE2308OQ18297A06836RX&s_subsrc=homepage


The app is designed to be used by two types of users:
- Staff at the conservation site.  
- wildlife preservation supporters who make donations through symbolic adoption of animals




Staff at the conservation site will be able to add/do the following
- Add a new wildlife profile (Besides the wildlife species name, important information such as conservation status, target funding, and a short description  )



Wildlife preservation supporters will be able to select an individual wildlife from the list and enter the amount of funding they wish to donate.

These will be added to a system which can be requested by the users to review the list of animals being sheltered at the preservation facility and review the total funding required for each individual wildlife at the conservation site. This application will guide users through what they should input to help them ensure that important information of each sheltered wildlife is correctly stored into the system. I hope to expand the scope of this project during term to include other features and increase the functionality of the app

User stories:

Phase 1


- As an admin user I want to be able to create and add new wildlife profile into the list of the wildlife in the conservation site
- As an admin user I want to be able to add important information for the added wildlife such as target funding, species name, conservation status, and admission date
- As an admin user I want to be able to view the number of wildlife that are accepting donations and wildlife that are fully funded
- As an admin user I want to be able to view the list of donors and their information (email address, donor ID, and profile creation date)
- As an admin user I want to be able to view the total amount of funding raised by wildlife in the facility

- As a donor user I want to be able to make donation to a wildlife that are not fully funded
- As a donor user I want to be able to create a donor profile with a self-created ID and an email address
- As a donor user I want to be able to view my donation records by 

Phase 2


Phase 3

- As a user I want to know the total funding required for animals of each conservation status
- As a feature the system will automatically remove the animals whose raised funds has exceeded the target funding. The extra funds collected in the last donation will be transferred to an wildlife that has the least funding and have the most concerned conservation status
