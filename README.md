# CPSC 210 Personal Project by Tong Liu
## Fund Tracking and Donation making App for wildlife conservatories
## Project Proposal:


A wildlife conservatory provides rescue and rehabilitation services to injured wildlife. The facility accepts and shelters injured wildlife and releases them to the wild once
they recover from the injury. A large portion of the funds that supports the facility is raised from the public through donations from animal lovers
To encourage donations from the public, many non-profit organizations created websites that contains the profiles of 
individual wildlife they attempt to rescue and encourage the public to make donations to their favorite animals through symbolic adoptions. one of the examples
can be accessed here (https://support.worldwildlife.org/site/Donation2?df_id=17797&17797.donation=form1&s_src=AWE2308OQ18297A06836RX&s_subsrc=homepage)


In my personal project, I want to design a donation management app for a newly established wildlife conservation facility. 
The app can be used to add and create profiles for wildlife that are rescued and sheltered at the facility and updates their donation records, list of donors
and the total amount of donations (funds) being collected through symbolic adoption (a form of donation). This app will allow the donor to make donation to a certain wildlife sheltered at the site. The same donor
will be able to track his/her donation records by using his donor profile ID. This project is particularly interesting to me as it 
can help the conservation facility to systematically track and manage the funding they collected from the public and helps them create
new strategy to attract public donations.

The app is designed to be used by two types of users:
- Administration team at the conservation site:
They will use the app to add new wildlife profile, track the donation records and funding progression of each wildlife at the facility. 


- People who wish to make donations to the wildlife in the facility:
They will use the app to navigate the list of wildlife in the site and make symbolic adoptions to their chosen ones, 
then they will be able to create donor profiles of their own, and track their donation records through the app



User stories:

Phase 1

- As an admin user I want to be able to add new wildlife to my wildlife conservation site
- As an admin user I want to be able to add important information for the added wildlife such as target funding, species name, conservation status, admission date, and a short description
- As an admin user I want to be able to view the list of wildlife in my conservation site
- As an admin user I want to be able to view the list of donors and their information (email address, donor ID, and profile creation date)

- As a donor user I want to be able to make donation to a wildlife in the conservation site
- As a donor user I want to be able to create a donor profile with a donor ID and an email address
- As a donor user I want to be able to view my donation records  

Phase 2
- As a user I want to be able to actively save the status of my conservatory to file at the main menu (with the save option)
- As a user, I want to be reminded to save the status of my conservatory to file when I quit the program at the main application menu 
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be able to load the data of my conservatory from file and restore the status (list of wildlife, funding progression, donors list and donation records) of
- my conservatory from previous usages.
