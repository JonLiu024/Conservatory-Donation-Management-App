## Wildlife sheltering tracking for preservation facility
## Project Proposal:

In this personal project, I would like to design a java application for wildlife sheltering tracking for a newly founded wildlife preservation facility. This app will allow the conservation biologists to raise and track fundings for each animal being sheltered at the facility. The app will allow donators to make and record their amount of donations



The app is designed to be used by two types of users:
- wildlife conservationists who enter the information of newly found animals into the database.  
- wildlife preservation supporters who make donations through symbolic adoption of the individual animals




Wildlife conservationist will be able to add/do the following
- Add orphaned animals
- Animal nickname
- Animal species name
- Endangered level of the species
- A short description or story behind the sheltered animals
- Target funding
- Shelter period
- Remove animals


Wildlife preservation supporters will be able to select an individual animal from the list and enter the amount of funding they wish to donate.

These will be added to a system which can be requested by the users to review the list of animals being sheltered at the preservation facility and review the total funding required for each animal species at the conservation sites. This application will guide users through what they should input to help them ensure that important information of each sheltered animal is correctly stored into the system. I hope to expand the scope of this project during the semester to include other features and increase the functionality of the app

User stories:

Phase 1


- As a user I want to be able to add new animal to the list of sheltered animals
- As a user I want to be able to add story/description and important information of the added animals
- As a user I want to be able remove an animal from the list of sheltered animals

Phase 2
- As a user I want to be able to view the number of animals currently at the facility at each endangered level  
- As a user I want to be able to view the required funding for the preservation facility
